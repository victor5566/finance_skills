# Finance Skills — Implementation Plan

## Overview

A mono-repo of Claude Code skill plugins for financial services. Each plugin is a
self-contained domain of skills that can be installed independently into a project's
`.claude/skills/` directory. Plugins declare dependencies on other plugins and share
a common skill template.

All **84 skills** are implemented across seven plugins (`core`, `wealth-management`,
`compliance`, `advisory-practice`, `trading-operations`, `client-operations`,
`data-integration`).

---

## Plugin Architecture

### Design Principles
- **`core` is implicit** — always installed; every plugin depends on it
- **Plugins are independently installable** — a project pulls only the domains it needs
- **Cross-plugin references are allowed** — skills reference related skills in other plugins via cross-references section
- **Skills live in `.claude/skills/`** — installation symlinks a plugin's skills into the target project's skill directory
- **No Python scripts for guidance-only skills** — compliance/operations plugins are guidance-only; quantitative plugins may have `scripts/` subdirectories

### Plugin Dependency Graph

```
core (implicit — always installed)
  ├── wealth-management
  ├── compliance  ←── (recommended for all plugins)
  ├── advisory-practice  ←── depends on wealth-management
  ├── trading-operations
  ├── client-operations
  └── data-integration
```

### Installation Model

```bash
# Install a plugin into a target project
./install.sh --plugin wealth-management --target /path/to/project

# This symlinks:
#   plugins/core/skills/*           → /path/to/project/.claude/skills/
#   plugins/wealth-management/skills/* → /path/to/project/.claude/skills/
```

Each plugin directory contains:
```
plugins/<plugin-name>/
├── plugin.json          # Metadata: name, description, dependencies, skill list
└── skills/
    ├── <skill-name>/
    │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   └── scripts/     # (optional) Python reference implementations
    └── ...
```

## Conventions

- **Python version**: 3.11+ (scripts are standalone helpers, no package install needed)
- **Dependencies**: numpy, scipy, pandas only (stdlib preferred where possible)
- **Scripts**: Each skill's `scripts/` dir contains runnable Python with clear functions
- **Formulas in SKILL.md**: LaTeX-style notation for clarity
- **Direction labeling**: Every concept tagged as retrospective or prospective
- **Compliance/operations conventions**: Guidance-only skills (no Python scripts). Worked examples use scenario-based format (**Scenario / Compliance Issues / Analysis**). Primary sources cited inline (rule numbers, act sections, form references).
- **Naming**: Skill directories use `lowercase-hyphenated`; Python files use `lowercase_underscore`
